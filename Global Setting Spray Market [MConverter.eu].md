**Introduction to Setting Sprays**

Setting spray is a beauty product designed to preserve the integrity of
makeup after application. Typically formulated as a light, misting
spray, it is applied to the face at the end of the cosmetic routine to
lock in the look, preventing smudging, fading, or transfer. Depending on
the formulation, setting sprays can also deliver secondary benefits such
as oil control, hydration, waterproofing, or a luminous glow.

The rise in consumer awareness regarding long-wear cosmetics and the
desire for flawless appearance---especially under different
environmental conditions---has significantly contributed to the
widespread popularity of setting sprays. With beauty routines becoming
more advanced and tailored, this product category continues to grow in
diversity and sophistication.

**Market Growth from 2018 to 2021**

Between 2018 and 2021, the global setting spray market witnessed steady
and measurable growth. The demand was driven largely by consumer
interest in enhancing makeup longevity, coupled with increasing
penetration of beauty products in emerging markets. This period also saw
the proliferation of beauty influencers and digital tutorials that
popularized complete makeup routines, including the use of setting
sprays.

Major cosmetic brands expanded their product portfolios to include
variations of setting sprays catering to different skin types and
desired finishes---such as dewy, matte, or radiant. The growth was also
supported by an increase in online retail channels and the rising trend
of self-expression through cosmetics.

**COVID-19 and Geopolitical Impacts on the Market**

The global COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical tensions stemming from
the Russia-Ukraine conflict introduced unforeseen challenges to the
beauty industry. Initially, during lockdown periods, there was a sharp
decline in demand for cosmetics due to reduced social interactions.
However, the situation also spurred an increase in digital beauty
consumption---live tutorials, e-commerce purchases, and virtual beauty
consultations rose significantly.

As the world adapted to the "new normal," the setting spray market
rebounded quickly, especially with the return of social events,
workplace routines, and travel. Additionally, the trend of wearing
makeup under masks prompted the need for smudge-proof, long-lasting
makeup solutions, further accelerating the demand for effective setting
sprays.

**Forecast and Market Outlook (2023--2030)**

Looking forward, the global setting spray market is expected to witness
robust growth, with its size projected to increase at a CAGR of 8.5%
from 2023 to 2030. By 2030, the market will have expanded substantially,
driven by consumer expectations for multifunctional, durable makeup
products and growing popularity of both high-end and affordable beauty
brands.

Key market dynamics include:

- A rise in consumer preference for cruelty-free, vegan, and organic
  formulations.
